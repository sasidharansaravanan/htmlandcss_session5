                    <h3>   Manage tasks with ease. </h3> <br>
<b>Members:</b> Keep everyone accountable and never have to ask “who’s doing that” by adding members to cards for their projects and tasks.  <br><br><br>
<b>Due dates:</b> They're easy to set, hard to miss (with reminders!), and oh-so-satisfying to mark as “done.” <br><br><br>
<b>Attachments:</b> No more digging through endless email chains to find attachments. Just drag and drop them onto a card so the right files stay with the right tasks. <br><br><br>

<b>Checklists:</b> Your best tool to overpower overwhelming asks. Break big tasks into small ones, check things off the list, and watch that status bar go to 100% complete.
